# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Yeho's GitHub
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a college student at POSTECH, Pohang Institute of Science and Technology, and also a machine learning (ML) engineer. I'm interested in CV (Computer Vision), ML Methodologies, and a sort of NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques. Look around my repositories and I hope you enjoy!

Most repositories you can see here are my toy projects, which are not done yet. There are few repositories for school contests. If you guys want to leave some comments to share on my repos, let me know, make issues! I'll check them out soon. Also, if you guys want to contribute to my projects, make PR (Pull Request).
