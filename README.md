# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Yeho's GitHub
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a college student, and also a machine learning (ML) engineer. I'm interested in CV (Computer Vision), ML Methodologies, and a sort of NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques. Look around my repositories and I hope you enjoy!
Most repositories you can see here are my toy projects, which are not done yet. There are a few repositories for school contests. If you guys have some comments to share on my repos, give me via issue! I'll check them out soon. Also, if you guys want to contribute to my projects, contact me via PR (Pull Request).
