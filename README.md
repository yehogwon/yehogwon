# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Yeho's GitHub
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a college student at POSTECH, Pohang Institute of Science and Technology, and also a machine learning (ML) engineer. I'm interested in computer vision techniques and machine learning methodologies. 

I am currently a research intern at CV (Computer Vision) Lab at POSTECH. My research interests lie mainly in image classification and active learning. I am working on these topics!

Most repositories you can see here are my toy projects, which are not done yet. There are few repositories for school contests. Look around my repositories and I hope you enjoy! 

If you want to leave some comments to share on my repos, let me know, make issues! I'll check them out soon. Also, if you want to contribute to my projects, make a PR.
